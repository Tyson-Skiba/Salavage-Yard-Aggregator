# Salvage yard search aggregator

Little project that searches pickles, manheim and grays for a vehicle.

## Tech

For this project i broke away from styled-components and instead used tailwind with post css.  
Templating is done using handlebars for both the static and express version of the page.  

## Running

This is a basic node project.  
To grab dependencies run `yarn` and then use `yarn run sreach` to start an express app on port 3002 or `yarn run search --print` to create a a page at `dist/results.html`.

## Demo

Demo can be found here.
